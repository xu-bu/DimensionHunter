After two players ensure the order, the rest 2 cards will be put in the bottom of deck, resolve their effects. Other 3 cards will be used in main phase. 
3. Resolve phase: resolve you and your opponent's card alternately. In each resolve, resolve position effect at first. In your turn, your first card resolves firstly, vice versa.
4. End phase: Put the cards used in main phase into graveyard.
5. Resolve phase: resolve additional effect.
